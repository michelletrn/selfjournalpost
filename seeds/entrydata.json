        "text": "Got to roll with a new girl in class, which is always fun! Its always nice to see a girl in the dojo, especially when you're surrounded by men every class. Jiu Jistu is a contact sport and requires more technique than strength. I find myself struggling when I roll with the men at the gym but end up feeling overpowered when I go back to someone in my weight range. I am really enjoying the community i'm growing to be a part of and feel so much better about my overall health. I recommend this sport to anyone who is looking for funtional training, body awarness, and overall natural strength. I will warn you though: you'll be walking home with a couple of bumps and bruises from time to time!üòÖ",

        "text": "While out during our vacation in Vermont with my boyfriend, Anthony, we found a niche vegan deli that had all kinds of vegan products. My favirote part about the place was the smoothie bar in the back of the establishment. It's rare to find a location blending fresh juices and smoothies. I tried their carrot juice, which was delicious, and bought some Jasmine Tea since i remembered I ran out before we left for our vacation. When back home in New Jersey, I had a chance to brew the tea. Let's just say i'll be visiting Vermont more often.",

As convenient as online shopping is, you lose a certain gratifying feeling you get when you purchase items in person. Spring is right around the corner so I decided I needed some sun dresses and new strappy sandels to compliment the dresses. Overall, it was a successful shopping trip and a well deserved one at that. Now back to coding!üë©üèª‚Äçüíª",

Coding is challenging and forces you to think outside the box. Now that I have graduated the coding bootcamp, i'm glad I can slow down and take my time to learn more about different coding languages and programs and continue practicing my code. The way i see it, as long as i'm learning somthing new everyday I can be confident that I am developing my coding skills at my own pace.",
